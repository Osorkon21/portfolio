      <div>
        <p>I am Peter Krause, an avid computer geek and gamer. I grew up in a household surrounded by PCs. My father is
          a software engineer, and he loved working with and building his own machines. I inherited that love, but I did
          not inherit his choice of career. He tried to pass programming on to me - and my siblings - to no avail. I was
          determined to forge my own path.</p>

        <p>Nearly two decades after turning up my nose at programming, I became interested in modding games. I dove
          into the Unity Engine and C# and I realized what I had been missing all these years. Imbued with a new sense
          of purpose, I began writing my own game in self-taught C++. After many hours of struggling alone, I decided
          the most efficient way to get into the programming industry was through formal training. This realization led
          me to the U of M Web Development Coding Bootcamp.</p>
